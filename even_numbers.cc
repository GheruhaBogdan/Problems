/*
DO NOT USE CHATGPT, YOU CAN ASK ME QUESTIONS
Because if you will use chat gpt for such easy problems, you're cooked. Better ask me and I will give you just ideas. ðŸ’¡
Make an array with 1000 numbers. Use the for loop for that. Make the numbers be random. Then show on the screen 
the even numbers and also how many of them you have example(292, 384, ..., you have 27 even numbers) 

Then make an option for the user to see even or odd numbers
